Beginning with the basics of HTML and\r\n        CSS from Codecademy, I found my way to The Odin Project. It's here that\r\n        I experienced the awesomeness of JavaScript followed by an adventure\r\n        through the workings of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. While the sheer mass of\r\n        information was overwhelming at times, I was absorbing new concepts at\r\n        every change I had.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Knowing the reality of affording a second college degree or attending a\r\n        bootcamp were out of the question, the plan was to continue the scouring\r\n        of the internet for additional free resources for learning. Around the\r\n        time of finishing The Odin Project curriculum, I applied for and\r\n        received a scholarship to complete the Udacity Front-End Developer\r\n        Nanodegree. This program exposed me to the JavaScript frameworks of the\r\n        world, with a special focus on React. At the same time, I also was given\r\n        the opportunity at one of my jobs to implement a MERN app to solve the\r\n        time management challenge faced by college students. In the end, the\r\n        nanodegree was finished well ahead of schedule and the app deployed to\r\n        production.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        \r\n      </p>\r\n    </main>\r\n    <Footer />\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n"],"mappings":";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;AAAA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAEA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AACA;AAFA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAKA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AAJA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAMA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAEA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AACA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AASA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAaA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAIA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAlDA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
