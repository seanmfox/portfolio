Beginning with the basics of HTML and\r\n        CSS from Codecademy, I found my way to The Odin Project. It's here that\r\n        I experienced the awesomeness of JavaScript followed by an adventure\r\n        through the workings of Ruby and Ruby on Rails. While the sheer mass of\r\n        information was overwhelming at times, I was absorbing new concepts at\r\n        every change I had.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Knowing the reality of affording a second college degree or attending a\r\n        bootcamp were out of the question, the plan was to continue the scouring\r\n        of the internet for additional free resources for learning.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </main>\r\n    <Footer />\r\n  </div>\r\n);\r\n"],"mappings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vCA;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;A","sourceRoot":""}
